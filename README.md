Basic Projects.
Pizza Delivery Order Form.

2 modules:--
2.1] Admin
2.2] Customer

Admin
Uses Dynamic login to authenticate themselves and then register customers and give them the acknowledgement receipt.

Customer
Chooses the food he wants to have.

For my code you need to explicitly install OLEDB 12.0 for Windows 10 64 bit config.

Developed in Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express.


Note:-- It is a basic project and doesn't include too many database constraints as per the security of the particular process is concerned.
